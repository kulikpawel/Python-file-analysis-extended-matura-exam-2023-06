Task 1. Binary anagram
There are 1000 lines in the anagram.txt file. Each line contains a binary number,
consisting of a maximum of 14 digits: 0 or 1. Each number begins with a one and none of them are repeated.

Note: The example.txt file contains 100 lines of matching sample data task conditions. The answers for the data in the example.txt file are provided below the content tasks.

Task 1.1.
A binary number is called balanced when it contains the same number of zeros and ones,
almost balanced when the number of ones differs from the number of zeros by 1.

Example:
The number 101010 is a balanced number.
The number 1011010 is an almost balanced number.
State how many balanced binary numbers there are and how many almost binary numbers there are
balanced in the anagram.txt file.
For data from the file example.txt, the correct answer is:
21
15

Task 1.2.
Digital anagrams are numbers made up of the same set of digits arranged in different ones
orders. The first digit of the number cannot be zero.
Example:
The number 209 written in decimal can be used to create 4 anagrams: 209, 902, 290, 920.
The binary number 11100 can be used to create 6 different anagrams: 10011, 10101, 10110,
11001, 11010, 11100.
Find all such 8-digit binary numbers in the file anagram.txt from which you can
create the largest number of anagrams. List these numbers in the order they appear
in the anagram.txt file.
For data from the file example.txt, the correct answer is:
10001011
10111000
10100111
11111000
10011100
11100011
10111010
10100011
10011010
10110001
11011010

Task 1.3.
Give the greatest absolute value of the difference between adjacent numbers (that is, numbers saved in adjacent lines, e.g. 1 and 2 lines, 2 and 3 lines, etc.) in the file anagram.txt. Give this value in binary notation.
For data from the file example.txt, the correct answer is:
1110001010


Task 1.4.
Replace all binary numbers in the anagram.txt file with their system equivalents decimal. Then from the resulting decimal numbers:
a) state how many numbers there are that do not contain the digit zero
b) give the number that has the largest sum of different digits (if numbers that have the same,
the largest sum of different digits is more than one - give the one that appears as first in the data file).
Example:
For the number 20462, the sum of its different digits is 12 (2+0+4+6), for the number 344, the sum of its different digits is 7.
For data from the file example.txt, the correct answer is:
81
